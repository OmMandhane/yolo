# yolo based robot that avoids obstacles and detect human
This was my first year engineering project. It is a random moving robot that avoids obstacles and detects humans using yolo 8vn object detection algorithm and says "human detected" in japanese voice when it detects humans. You can see the image of the bot in the finalprojectimage.jpg file

This robot uses a phone camera. The video is sent to a url using the IP Webcam app available on playstore. This url is then used in your laptop where the python file yolo is run. The detected objects are boxed and the "human detected" audio is played in your pc when it detects human

So the projects has two parts the hardware and software For the hardware part and the arduino code, im providing a tinker cad link- https://www.tinkercad.com/things/17ERrVcWsyp

And for the software part the complete code is available in this repository
